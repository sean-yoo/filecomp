### File Compression Web Application
Wrote File Compression Web Application in JavaScript using front end interface in React.
Tools Utilized: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

This project is my experimentation and implementation of compression algorithms used in File Compression softwares. I currently have a working model of Huffman Coding optimized for English texts. Texts are compressed to best case 60% of original file size. 

I am currently trying to figure out how to best optimize huffman coding for many different file types, as well as studying how to utilize huffman coding and LZ77 compression to replicate Deflate compression algorithm found in many modern compression softwares.

Project Checklist:
- ~~Compress Component~~
- ~~Create input for file~~
- ~~Compress button and onClick Command~~
- ~~Huffman Coding Algorithm Method~~
- Optimize Huffman Coding for Beyond Text Files
- Create file and download function for compressed file
- Decompress Component



In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
